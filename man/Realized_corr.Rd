\title{Computing Realized Correlation}
\usage{
Realized_corr(realized_variances, realized_covariances, fisher_transf = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{realized_variances}{Dataset of realized volatilities. A matrix or something that can be coerced to a matrix. Note: the volatilities must not be in logs.}

\item{realized_covariances}{Dataset of realized covariances. A matrix or something that can be coerced to a matrix.}

\item{fisher_transf}{Logical: if TRUE the correlations are computed and Fisher-transformed}
}
\value{
LM test statistics and p-values: asymptotic, with finite sample correction and asymptotic with heteroscedasticity correction and Lasso selections are printed to the console
}
\description{
This function computes realized correlations from realized variances and covariances with the possibility of
Fisher-transforming the realized correlations.
